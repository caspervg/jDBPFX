jDBPFX
======

This Java library provides methods to read and write DBPF formatted files. It is
mainly meant to support the DBPF file types used by SimCity 4.

Installation
------------
Download the source files to a local directory and run Apache Ant to compile
the sources, using the included build.xml file.

Contributions
-------------
Most of the work in this project was done by jondor - it is directly based upon
his work -, and it also shares its roots with the SC4DBPF4J library by Stefan79,
see http://sourceforge.net/projects/sc4dbpf4j/. This jDBPFX package is a
combination of the two, aiming at higher consistency and facilitating common
operations. The main differences can be found in the `DBPFFile` and `DBPFEntry`
classes, as described in the Javadoc comments.
