/**
 * An abstract form of an entry of a {@link DBPFFile}, representing an instance
 * of a subfile that may be contained in a DBPF file. The {@link DBPFFile.Writer}
 * takes these entries to write to a new DBPF file.
 * <p>
 * There are three fundamentally different implementing Subclasses:
 * <dl>
 * <dt><b>{@link DirectDBPFEntry}</b>
 * <dd>
 * A direct DBPF entry basically represents an entry of the index table of a DBPF
 * file. The entry inherently linked to this
 * {@code DBPFFile}, as it does not maintain a copy of its data, but holds a
 * link to the data stored on disk within the DBPF file. The only way to obtain
 * an instance of a {@code DirectDBPFEntry} is to call one of the
 * {@link DBPFFile#getEntry(long) getEntry} or {@link DBPFFile#getEntries() getEntries}
 * methods in {@code DBPFFile}.
 * <p>
 * A direct DBPF entry is best suited for DBPF file IO where its data is merely
 * transferred, but not changed, as the actual type represented by the entry does
 * not matter. It is not necessary to hold all the data in memory simultaneosly,
 * as the data will be read and discarded as needed.
 * <p>
 * <b>Attention</b> should be paid to the fact that the data is not permanently in memory.
 * It is the responsibility of the calling programm to ensure that the enclosing
 * DBPFFile is not modified or removed during the lifetime of the direct entry,
 * or its data may be lost. The behaviour in this case is unspecified and should
 * be avoided (see also {@link DBPFFile.Reader#readCached(java.io.File)
 * DBPFFile.Reader.readCached}).
 *
 * <dt><b>{@link DBPFType}</b>
 * <dd>
 * A {@code DBPFType} usually holds its data itself and can exist without an
 * enclosing DBPF file. <b>Attention</b> should be paid to the fact that creating a large
 * amount of DBPFTypes will be memory-intensive, as all their data resides in heap space
 * of the JVM.
 * <p>
 * DBPFTypes may be obtained by calling one of the
 * {@link DirectDBPFEntry#createType() createType} methods of a {@code
 * DirectDBPFEntry}, whenever working with the actual type of the entry is
 * desired.
 *
 * <dt><b>Custom Subclasses</b>
 * <dd>
 * The only method that needs to be implemented is the {@link #createDataChannel} method,
 * hence, the Writer will be able to write the entry to a file. This can be easily done
 * by an anonymous inner type. This approach will be used less frequently, but it is
 * especially suitable for large raw data entries. It would be impractical to convert
 * these to byte arrays, in between.
